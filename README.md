After upgrading macOS to Big Sur, Python build using pyenv did not work properly, such as readline library not being compiled. Thankfully, GitHub allows you to build code and upload artifacts on macOS Catalina.

How to use: Download the desired Python version artifact from GitHub Action and unzip it to ~/.pyenv/versions to complete the installation.
